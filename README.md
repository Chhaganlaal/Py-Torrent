# Py-Torrent
A simple Bittorrent program in Python implementing client-side protocol. Currently only looks for UDP trackers and doesn't support multithreading.

Some of the resources I referred:

 - http://www.kristenwidman.com/blog/33/how-to-write-a-bittorrent-client-part-1/ : Refer this to get a basic idea about the Bittorrent client and how the protocol works.
 - https://wiki.theory.org/BitTorrentSpecification#Handshake : This page provides an in-depth specification (unofficial) about the Bittorrent Protocol. Everything that one needs to get going for this project.
 - https://allenkim67.github.io/programming/2016/05/04/how-to-make-your-own-bittorrent-client.html : This is a really good in depth step by step guide in JavaScript which I followed.
